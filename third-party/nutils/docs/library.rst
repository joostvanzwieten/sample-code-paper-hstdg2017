The Nutils are separated in modules focussing on topics such as mesh generation,
function manipulation, debugging, plotting, etc. They are designed to form
relatively independent units, though some components such as output logging run
through all. Others, such as topology and element, operate in tight connection,
but are divided for reasons of scope and scale. A typical Nutils application
uses methods from all modules, although, as seen above, very few modules require
direct access for standard computations.

What follows is an automatically generated API reference.
